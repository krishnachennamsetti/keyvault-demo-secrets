* Create a service principal under your active directory or everybody will have a default active directory. You can create service principal by going under Azure Active Directory -> app registrations -> new registraion.
* Once you create a service principal create a secret for it and store the secret value as it will not be revealed later.
* Now Go to your keyvault and enable permissions for webapp and service principal to do that got to Your keyvault -> Access Configuration -> Under Permission model select Vault access policy -> Go to access policies -> create -> Select the template -> I selected Key,Secret and Certificate management -> next -> under principal select your webapp and service principal one by one and save it.
